[{"categories":["blog","github"],"contents":"Running a blog in 2021? Well, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a billion or two ways to run one, anything from running an old WordPress site to running something as AWS Lambda.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t fancy maintaining anything and there were some tools I wanted to use.\nThis web site is built with Hugo that is one of the most popular open-source static site generators, or at least that\u0026rsquo;s what they say https://gohugo.io/. It\u0026rsquo;s written in go so it must be..\nThe theme is Horthernlab by Themefisher, https://themes.gohugo.io/northendlab-hugo/ that is powered by Bootstrap 4 and responsive ready \u0026ndash; whatever that means, if it isn\u0026rsquo;t ready, I might switch to something else.\nThe source for the site is hosted on a private repository on Github. Whenever the content is updated, a Github Actions workflow will be triggered that will build the website with hugo. The resulting site is then uploaded to another, public Github repository that is available as Github Pages site.\n","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/2021-04-05-b-blog-platform/","tags":null,"title":"Blog platform"},{"categories":["forewords","foreword"],"contents":"Let\u0026rsquo;s get started! This blog will be about our move to the apptly called house called Pilvilinna, Cloud Castle. The apartment we have bought is called cloud castle and it\u0026rsquo;s in a 100+ year old mental institute neighbourhood.\nThe objective is to document the plans and decisions for various things with regards to the new apartment, from networking to home automation, from the plans to purchase an EV to even furniture and perhaps even coffee \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s always room for a new espresso machine, right?\nAlso part of the plan is see how the existing items and configurations from the current apartment will fit to the new place, where it makes sense to upgrade, and what is better just to abandon. And let\u0026rsquo;s not forget about the cloud \u0026ndash; there will be connectivity to AWS, Azure and Google Cloud of course.\nSome keywords about the current setup; FreeNAS, Kubernetes, Raspberry Pi, Zigbee, Home Assistant, Node Red, Philips Hue, Apple TV, Mikrotik, EdgeRouter, TP-Link, 802.11ac, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and so on..\n","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/2021-04-05-a-foreword/","tags":null,"title":"Forewords for Pilvilinna"},{"categories":["internet","network"],"contents":"Internet connectivity \u0026ndash; 1 Gbit/s must have one.\nIn our current apartment the options are somewhat limited, most of the carriers offer just VDSL (or 4G/5G) but luckily there\u0026rsquo;s HFC cable TV network and DNA offers 1 Gbit/s service over it.\nDNA\u0026rsquo;s service has been pretty stable and performance has been both excellent and consistent, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get 900+ Mbit/s over it. The connection is with Sagecom\u0026rsquo;s F-3686AC modem that has worked fine, apart from DNA\u0026rsquo;s updates that reset the configuration every couple of years. This modem will be sold when we move.\nDNA offers both IPv4 and IPv6, they provide /56 prefix with DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation and the home network has been dual-stack for years. IPv6 just works, as they say..\nFor Internet connection the new apartment will have Elisa\u0026rsquo;s fiber available that will offer a 1 Gbit/s service. As it\u0026rsquo;s native ethernet, the performance should be slightly better than now and with stable upstream.\nUnfortunately Elisa doesn\u0026rsquo;t do IPv6 yet on their fixed connections so what to do with IPv6? I will try to contact old friends at Elisa to see if there\u0026rsquo;s any beta programs to join, or perhaps kuusitunneli.fi will be fast enough. I do want to get IPv6 but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay too much performance penalty for it.\n","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/2021-05-05-b-internet/","tags":null,"title":"Reflections - Internet"},{"categories":["wired","network"],"contents":"Networking \u0026ndash; let\u0026rsquo;s think about cables first.\nIn our current apartment we have ethernet wall plates around the apartment but as this has been built around 15 years afgo, the cabling is probably Cat5e as it cannot handle anything above 1 Gbit/s that well.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s time to set the \u0026ldquo;standard bar\u0026rdquo; higher \u0026ndash; if possible, have at least 2.5 Gbit/s around the new apartment.\nThere all ethernet wall plates around the new apartment but the details are still unclear. As it\u0026rsquo;s a few years old construction, the cables could well handle 2.5 or even 5 Gbit/s.\nIf possible, 10 Gbit/s should be used.\nSwitches The current standard gigabit-switches and a few Mikrotik\u0026rsquo;s should be a good starting point. The Mikrotik\u0026rsquo;s have some SFP+ ports for faster connections.\nThere are some inexpensive 2.5GE switches arriving to the market, for example 5- and 8-port devices from TRENDnet. This should be fine to use.\nVLANs This is a tricky part.. Currently the IPv4 ranges are split into fictitious /24 blocks based on the usage but it\u0026rsquo;s a shared ethernet domain. IPv6 has been dynamic.\nI would like to switch to a few VLANs, perhaps not based on the usage itself but depending on the security requirements for the devices. For the devices to work this may require mDNS repeater between the VLANs on the router.\n","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/2021-05-05-a-network/","tags":null,"title":"Reflections - Wired networking"},{"categories":null,"contents":"x\u0026mdash; title: \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; draft: false description : \u0026ldquo;this is meta description\u0026rdquo; layout: tools ","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/tools/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labor.\n","permalink":"https://petri-ojala.github.io/blog/contact/","tags":null,"title":"Contact Us"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
